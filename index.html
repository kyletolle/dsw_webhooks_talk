<p>Government Agency for Bear Attacks</p>

<aside class="notes">

This fictional organization will help make things a little more concrete.
Explain how they'll use Fulcrum.
People in the office will specify what kind of data they want to collect about
bear attacks. People in the office, like forest rangers, will be the ones
collecting the data about the bear attacks.

<section>

<h1 id="startups">Startups</h1>

<p>Staying small, focused, and agile</p>

<p>makes your value clear</p>

<aside class="notes">

Have a niche. Solve one problem well.
Don't build an entire ecosystem.
Focus gives you differentiation. You're not cluttered.

</aside>

<section>

<h2 id="importance-of-access">Importance of access</h2>

<p>Give customers easy access to their data</p>

<p>Avoid vendor lock-in</p>

<p>Build goodwill</p>

<aside class="notes">

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="flexibility-is-your-power">Flexibility is your power</h2>

<p>They fit you into their workflow</p>

<p>More likely to use your service</p>

<aside class="notes">

When you don't dictate their workflow, they have an easier time adopting you
to how they do things. This is good.
They can fit your offering in with other services.
They stay nimble, and can get more done.
You're more valuable to them by being accessible.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="hard-coded-integration">Hard-coded integration</h2>

<p>Integrating with specific services can make sense</p>

<p>But you have to predict it</p>

<p>And then maintain it</p>

<aside class="notes">

Can be powerful and valuable.
More effort initially.
Integrations are limited to what you have built.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="a-single-general-approach-for-integrations">A single, general approach for integrations</h2>

<p>is even better for allowing many of them</p>


<aside class="notes">

You don't have to predict everything your customers might need.
Don't write one-off code for each integration.
Stay focused on your core offering.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="flexible-going-forward">Flexible going forward</h2>

<p>Not hardcoding for the service-du-jour</p>

<p>Integrate with other services that are relevant later</p>

<aside class="notes">

You'll be able to integrate more easily with services that don't even
exist now. Lots of new things popping up every day.
Adding these integrations will be easier and cheaper.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="buying-you-relevancy">Buying you relevancy</h2>

<p>You’re giving customers the flexibility to do anything they want</p>

<p>Better chance of fitting into their business and workflow over time</p>

<p>Keeping your focus helps you own your niche</p>

<aside class="notes">

Only the customer really knows what they're trying to do and how to best do
it.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="document-it-well">Document it well</h2>

<p>Make it easy for users to understand and get started with</p>

<p>Document it so they can build their own integrations</p>

<p>Also a good starting point if you do integration work for clients</p>

<h3 id="the-client-calls-us">The client calls us</h3>

<aside class="notes">

When our clients want their data, they make a request to our servers.
The people in the office will use our API to get our their data on bear
attacks.

<h3 id="to-do-things-with-it">To do things with it!</h3>

<aside class="notes">

Their data is important. Taking action on it is valuable. Acting quickly gives
them an advantage.
They can share it with the public. Analyze it. Try to prevent more bear
attacks.

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h2 id="how-do-they-use-the-api">How do they use the API?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Call our API</li>
  <li>Frequently</li>
  <li>In a script/application</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">

They write a script to hit our API every few days, or hours, or seconds
and do something with the data they get back.

<section>

<h3 id="how-long-until">How long until</h3>

<p>someone murders your servers?</p>

<aside class="notes">

They're likely to push the limits. Maybe they'll write an infinite loop which
hits your API as fast as it can.

Or, they'll have some "mission critical" need for ONE MILLION calls per month.
That's not a made up number. We had someone whose script really did this.

It's bad enough if one person does this, but imagine a few more people doing
the same thing. These legitimate requests can end up swamping your servers.

<aside class="notes">

This isn't an existential crisis, I promise.
So what do I mean?

</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h3 id="most-polls-wont-return-new-data">Most polls won’t return new data</h3>

<aside class="notes">

The rate of their polling is constant.
They do it once every few seconds.
But the rate of their data changing is variable.
Maybe it only changes every couple days, or only during business hours.

Meaning, a majority of their polls won't return anything to act on.

They're hitting up yuor server all the time, and usually it's for nothing.
Talk about disappointing.

<h2 id="section">#4</h2>

<h3 id="and-its-still-not-real-time">And it’s still not Real-Time™</h3>

<aside class="notes">

Additionally, to approach acting in real-time, they have to poll more and
more frequently. Except that, even when polling faster, they won't have truly
Real-Time™ data.

<aside class="notes">

Our clients have better things to do than write the code for polling.
So we'll be the ones to write the code to send them their data.

We have control over how the sending works. So we can tailor the loads to
something we define as feasible.

<h3 id="fewer-resources-required">Fewer resources required</h3>

Because we're not making as many requests as we would be with polling.

something has happened.
We never make a request that has no data.

Notes:
Companies large and small use webhooks to do more with their service.
Even if you don't implement them in your software, it can be nice to
understand how other people use them.

<p>## How to convey the business value</p>

<p>TODO: How to sell it to your managers. Need to process that section and work
it into the stuff above…</p>

<h1 id="section">#</h1>

<p>Customers don’t mind paying for a service as long as they can get their data
out</p>

<p>They can pull it into their own DBs</p>

<p>Run it through their own analysis.</p>

<p>They can swap out their entire pipeline if they want, but they can still use
webhooks here. That’s awesome!</p>

<h1 id="section-1">#</h1>

<p>We’ve found it easy to get customers to adopt our service when they’re
replacing a link in their chain.</p>

<p>We’re not forcing them to rebuild their world.
They can slot us in, without rearchitecting the world.</p>

<p>They can design their workflow.</p>

<h1 id="section-2">#</h1>

<p>Although, because it’s a general pattern, people have to implement the
specifics.o</p>

<p>Some effort they have to give.</p>

<p>But things like Zapier make that a lot easier.</p>

<h1 id="section-3">#</h1>

<p>People don’t even have to care about this at all initially</p>

<p>But it’s something we offer</p>

<p>And as their use of our service grows, webhooks allows them to do more with
our service.</p>

<p>We give them the power to keep on growing and continue to use us.</p>

<h1 id="section-4">#</h1>

<p>Webhooks and Api are a good way to give them access to their data</p>

<p>You’re more plug-n-play</p>

<h2 id="foundation-to-build-on">Foundation to build on</h2>

<p>Internal features could be built on this too.</p>

<p>Use the notifications to kick off some other functionality.</p>

<p>But you don’t need to add it to the core of your system.</p>

<p>Potential here for micro-services.</p>

<p>##</p>

<p>Webhooks allow 2 applications to talk together easily</p>

<p>One application listens for messages, and then does something with it</p>

<p>Makes it easier to build integrations</p>

<h2 id="how-we-use-webhooks">How we use webhooks</h2>

<p>GeoBooze
  - When people are enjoying a beverage, they can take a picture and then
    upload the info about it, and that goes into slack. I think this is an
    incoming webhook.</p>

<p>Slack
  - Support emails get put into slack
  - Support tickets from tender get put into slack
  - Support chats from intercom get put into slack
  - Github commits, issues, and PRs get put into slack</p>

<p>TODO: What about Slack Incoming/Outgoing webhooks? Look at the docs.</p>

<h2 id="how-people-use-webhooks-in-fulcrum">How people use webhooks in Fulcrum</h2>

<p>To sync with an external database or service.
Mirroring a table that exists in MySQL.
Syncing data to CartoDB for visualization.
Sending email notifications to manager when a new record is created and the
status is “needs immediate attention.”</p>

<h2 id="use-webhooks-as-a-notification">Use webhooks as a notification</h2>

<p>Our API serves up records JSON which needs to be cross referenced with the
form JSON, which is the schema to understand it. (This is what makes fulcrum
so flexible.) So you have to parse through it, which isn’t fun to do for
simple tasks.</p>

<p>If you treat the webhook like a notification, then fetch the data from another
endpoint which is more human readable, that’s also a possibility. Makes it
super easy to do certain things like update external databases this way.</p>

<p>This is using webhooks with data shares.
Explain data shares a little. Easy way to share your data with external people
who don’t need accounts. It’s like a public, read-only feed of your data.</p>

<p>Data shares are more easily consummable than the JSON from the API. Makes
simple integrations easier to set up, since you don’t have to parse the data
schema and the data.</p>

<h2 id="pushbullet-for-push-notifications">Pushbullet for push notifications</h2>

<p>Someone in the office assigns a record
That person who needs to do the work is texted a link
The link is a deep link that opens fulcrum and prepopulates a new record with
some information.</p>

<p>Could do something like notify people within a certain geographic area. You
could also assign the person who is known to be the closest.</p>

<h2 id="google-app-scripts">Google App Scripts</h2>

<p>No server setup.</p>

<p>Create a JS script, just like you would a Google Doc.</p>

<p>Share it just like a google doc as well.</p>

<aside class="notes">

No heroku or setting up a PHP server.

<h2 id="webhooks-as-a-workflow">Webhooks as a Workflow</h2>

<p>When a record is submitted, you can use a webhook to fetch data from another
web service (like weather information), and then use the API to update the
record. Automatically fetch weather information, based on the location.</p>

<p>Jason wrote a blog post about using the weather information. Bryan
wants to do something like this for GeoBooze to add ABV data.</p>

<p>Allows you to programattically add data from another service, based on
whatever rules you want.</p>

<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>

<p>Our users can do all sorts of custom things. We can help them get set up, or
they can do it themselves. But it’s nice that it’s a standard approach for
each of these customers. The entire world isn’t one-off.</p>

<p>Lowers the barrier to integrations. They can read the docs and get started
themselves.
It’s a force multiplier.</p>

<p>We don’t have a huge engineering team, so it allows us to have a greater
impact.</p>

<p>We don’t need a developer to add stuff to our core product for these
integrations.</p>
